# T-SQL (Transact-SQL, MSSQL) grammar

This is a community supported grammar file for t-sql, it is cool, yet not very complete 
so far because a grammar reference of T-SQL is hard to find.
MS website has grammar reference for different statements,
but it's not a complete file, so we try hard to stick to the references we could find,
and bit by bit make it a more complete grammar.
